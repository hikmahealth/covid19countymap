Overview
--------

This project contains a crowdsourced dataset of local policies enacted in response to COVID-19, broken down by local community in the United States. A visual map interface to the data is available [here](https://hikmahealth.org/map). All of the structured data can be downloaded from the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/hikmahealth/covid19countymap/tree/gh-pages), while all of the code to process the data is available as [Python notebooks](https://github.com/hikmahealth/covid19countymap/tree/master/notebooks). You can read our preliminary analysis of the dataset published [here](https://www.jmir.org/2020/12/e24614).

Data Sources
-------
Data on COVID-19 policies enacted at the local level was manually researched, entered into a web form, and validated in a crowdsourcing approach organized by [Hikma Health](https://www.hikmahealth.org/). 

The US County Policies Dataset currently includes over 2,700 observations of policy data from over 1,300 US counties, comprising over 250 million residents. Recommended citation for this dataset:

State policy data was obtained from the following [report](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/#policyactions) by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Case counts displayed by county were obtained from the [New York Times dataset](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).

Demographic and geographic information about  states and counties were obtained from the [United States Census](https://www.census.gov/).

County COVID R estimates are a subset of the estimates made by the models created by Youyang Gu [here](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections).

County Election Returns are from: MIT Election Data and Science Lab, 2018, "County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2016", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ, Harvard Dataverse.
