"Notes"
"For purposes of this table, states were included if they mandated the listed actions. A number of states released guidance or recommendations related to the actions listed in this table but fell short of issuing a requirement and are thus not included."


Footnotes
"1. While the CA governor has not officially mandated the statewide closure of schools, the state's mandatory quarantine order effectively closes all schools."
"2. These states have not formally issued stay at home orders; however, other actions, including closing non-essential businesses, banning large gatherings, and issuing advisories urging residents to stay home, have had the same effect."
"3. CT, RI, and WV have prohibited gatherings larger than five people, with limited exceptions."
"4. The FL governor has prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people in public spaces, but limits on private gatherings have fallen short of a mandate."
"5. Governors in GA, IA, LA, ND, and VA have closed many, but not all, non-essential businesses."
"6. Please see links in Sources tab for more details."
"7. NE has enacted a large gatherings ban and bar/restaurant limits in counties where community spread has been confirmed."
"8. OK has mandated closure of all non-essential businesses and limited bar/restaurants to carry-out and delivery only in affected counties."
"9. The TX governor has ordered that every person in Texas shall, except where necessary to provide or obtain essential services, minimize social gatherings and minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household"
"10. Gatherings also limited to 50% of venue capacity if such limitation would be under 50 people."
